# Share Deck

## Small Group?

Sharing a deck makes it available to the general public. If the deck you want to share is only of interest to a small group of people, please use the computer version to [share it privately](https://docs.ankiweb.net/contrib.html#sharing-decks-privately) instead. Decks that receive very few downloads will be removed automatically.

## Large Deck?

Shared decks are limited to 250MB in size. If your deck is larger than 250MB, please split it into multiple decks and share them separately. To check the size of the shared deck, please use File>Export in the computer version, and then look at the size of the .apkg file that is created.

Description:
This is a deck for practicing recognizing [resistor color codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code#Color_band_system) for resistors with 3 or 4 bands, as described in IEC 60062. It includes the [E6, E12, and E24 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_series_of_preferred_numbers) as well as the zero Ohm resistor.

More information about the deck. Please be specific, as decks that don't contain a useful description may be removed. Text is interpreted as markdown, with support for images, lists and links.
