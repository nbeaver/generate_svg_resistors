To learn resistor color codes,
I find it better to practice on example resistors
rather than try to `memorize the values of each color with mnemonics`_.
This script generates SVG images of 3 and 4-band resistors
in the `E6, E12, and E24 series`_
as well as the zero Ohm resistor.
Note that some value might be unrealistically large,
e.g. most through-hole resistors are not in the giga-ohm range.

This can then be used with the TSV file to create a practice deck
for use with the Anki spaced repetition program.
The shared deck page is available on AnkiWeb here:
